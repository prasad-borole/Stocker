we have implemented techniques mentioned in the research paper “Twitter mood predicts the stock market” by Prof. Johan Bollen. We have used twitter data to predict public mood in 6 different mood dimensions and use predicted mood and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) values to predict stock market. 
After collecting twitter data and DJIA stock values data, we first performed sentiment analysis(considering slang and emojis) to compute scores of 6 Profile of mood states (POMS) mood dimensions. We then computed the negation of this 6 dimensions and perform combinations on this total 12 mood dimensions to produce new 286 combinations. 
We then used Granger Causality analysis to find out mood dimension time series which best correlates with DJIA stock values for different lags of days. We found out that mood dimension [anger, confusion, tension] best correlates with DJIA stock values when lag was of 2 days.
We then used linear regression model to predict stock values for two months training linear model on five previous months of data.
